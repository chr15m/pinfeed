Full-size Pinterest image feed.

I use Pinterest for referencing art during drawing practice. I found it hard to access the full resolution images through the Pinterest interface, so I made this app to browse and view collections at full resolution.

### Self-host

This is a Flask app. Deploy with WSGI etc. You can use [Piku](https://piku.github.io/).

### Dev

`make watch` then browse to `localhost:8000`.

### Who
